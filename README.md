## [Introduction](#introduction)

Paed&Obst Calculator is a mobile application that help manage the complexities of patient management for paediatric & obstetric patients.
This app helps to solve the issue of having to remember the many sub-sets of vital signs for paediatric patients and the arithmetic calculations needed to calculate between Estimated Date of Delivery, Last Menstrual Period and Gestation Week for an obstetric patient. 

App created with reference to the Paediatric Vital Signs Reference Chart created by Dr. Chris Novak, a paediatric resident at the University of Alberta, and Dr. Peter Grill, a staff paediatrician at The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada with reference to PALS Guidelines, 2015.

## [ProjectContext](#projectcontext)
- Paramedics manage a wide array of patients, ranging from geriatric(elderly), obstetric & gynecology, to newborn. Each requiring their own specialised care. Realistically not possible to remember every single vital sign for each age group to great accuracy. Possibility patient mismanagement


- Appropriate pre-hospital assessment and management of paediatric & obstetric patients is challenging and requires dedicated knowledge and resources to ensure the best outcomes
